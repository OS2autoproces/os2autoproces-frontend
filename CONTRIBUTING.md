# Contributing
Contributions to the project have to go through the process described in this section.

After cloning the project and setting up a local dev environment, create a new git branch and commit all relevant changes.

When done making changes:
1. Update the version number in package.json by following the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) rules.
1. Add a section to the CHANGELOG.md file describing your changes.
1. Tag the last commit with the new version number.
1. Create a pull request and wait for a reviewer to either approve, reject or request changes to your work.
